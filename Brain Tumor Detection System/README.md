### 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning (WIP)

> 🚧 **This project is currently under development.**
> Core model architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation are **incomplete** as of now.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based classifier that detects brain tumors from MRI images. The current notebook contains initial steps such as:

* Setting up the environment
* Preparing the dataset
* Some basic exploration and setup for model building

**However, model training, validation, and deployment are yet to be implemented.**

## 📌 Goals

* [x] Dataset import and inspection
* [ ] Data preprocessing and augmentation
* [ ] Model architecture design (CNN)
* [ ] Model training & evaluation
* [ ] Saving/loading trained model
* [ ] Final accuracy & performance metrics
* [ ] UI or deployment (optional)

## 🔧 Requirements

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```
