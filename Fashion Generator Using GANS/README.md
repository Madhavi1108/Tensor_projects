# 🧵 Fashion Image Generation using GANs

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow to generate realistic fashion item images similar to those in the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Complete Code
Coming soon — sample generated images and training progression.

## 📌 Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most powerful frameworks for generative modeling. This project focuses on training a GAN to create synthetic but visually realistic fashion images by learning from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset.

The GAN consists of:
- A **Generator** that creates fake images.
- A **Discriminator** that tries to distinguish between real and fake images.

Both networks are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game until the generator produces highly realistic outputs.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end GAN implementation in TensorFlow
- Real-time visualization of training progress
- Custom training loop with feedback-based improvements
- Fashion image generation from random noise vectors

## 📂 Dataset

- **Fashion MNIST**: 60,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories like shirts, shoes, bags, etc.
- Source: [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist)

## 🛠️ How it Works

1. **Load Dataset** using `tensorflow_datasets`.
2. **Preprocess Data** by normalizing and batching.
3. **Build Generator** using `Conv2DTranspose` layers to upscale noise into 28x28 images.
4. **Build Discriminator** using `Conv2D` layers to classify real vs fake images.
5. **Train GAN** using binary cross-entropy loss.
6. **Visualize Progress** using matplotlib after every few epochs.

## 🖥️ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-gan.git
cd fashion-gan
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Required packages:

```bash
tensorflow
tensorflow-datasets
matplotlib
```

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
# Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Fashion_images_using_GANS.ipynb
```

You can also convert it to a Python script:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script Fashion_images_using_GANS.ipynb
python Fashion_images_using_GANS.py
```

## 📊 Results

After training for several epochs, the generator begins producing realistic images that resemble the original fashion MNIST items.

## 🧠 Future Improvements

* Train on higher resolution datasets
* Add conditional GAN support
* Use advanced architectures (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN, StyleGAN)
* Web interface to generate images in real time
